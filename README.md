# QBS181-Data-Wrangling-Project
The proliferation of short-term rental (STR) platforms, such as Airbnb, has profoundly reshaped urban hous-
ing markets, introducing both economic opportunities and significant challenges [1]. The impact of STRs on
housing affordability and neighborhood composition is a subject of intense debate among urban planners and
policymakers [2]. However, rigorous analysis is often hampered by the poor quality and heterogeneity of pub-
licly available data, which frequently suffers from inconsistencies, missing values, and disparate formats [3].
Effectively addressing these data quality issues through a systematic data wrangling process is a critical and
necessary prerequisite for any robust empirical analysis [4]. Without a clean and integrated dataset, conclusions
drawn about market dynamics remain tentative and potentially misleading. We will analyze data from New
York City as a case study to develop a reproducible pipeline for cleaning and integrating multi-source datasets
related to the STR market. The complex data landscape of NYC provides an study environment to address these
data wrangling challenges, which we specifically aim to resolve in this study.
